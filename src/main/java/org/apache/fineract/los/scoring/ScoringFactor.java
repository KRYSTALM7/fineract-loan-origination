/**
 * Strategy interface for a single credit scoring factor.
 *
 * <p>Each implementation evaluates exactly one dimension of creditworthiness — income ratio, debt
 * burden, employment stability, repayment history, or loan purpose risk — and returns a bounded
 * {@link FactorScore}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Pure</strong> — no side effects, no database or network access, deterministic
 *       output for the same input
 *   <li><strong>Bounded</strong> — {@code score()} must never return points exceeding {@code
 *       maxPoints()}
 *   <li><strong>Stateless</strong> — safe for concurrent use as a singleton Spring bean
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>New factors can be added by implementing this interface and registering as a Spring bean —
 * {@link DefaultCreditScoringStrategy} discovers all factors via constructor injection without
 * requiring code changes.
