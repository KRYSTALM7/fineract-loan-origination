/**
 * Immutable input model for the credit scoring engine.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately decoupled from the {@code ApplicantProfile} and {@code LoanApplication} JPA
 * entities — the scoring engine must never depend on persistence-layer classes. This allows scoring
 * to be unit tested without any database or Spring context, and allows the scoring module to be
 * extracted into a separate library in the future if needed.
 *
 * <p>Built exclusively via the {@link Builder} — no public constructor or setters, preventing
 * partially-constructed instances from entering the scoring pipeline.
